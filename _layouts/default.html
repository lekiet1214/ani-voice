    ## About

    ani-voice is a software to turn your (not so) ugly voice into a cute anime girl voice.
    And also translate your voice into Japanese.

    ## Installing and Running

    ### Requirements

    - Windows 11 or later

    - Python 11.0 or later. Get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    - VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device. Get it from [here](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)

    - VOICEVOX engine. Get it from [here](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine/releases/tag/0.14.4)

    Note that this software is not tested on other platforms.

    ### Installing

    1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lekiet1214/ani-voice.git
    ```

    2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ### Configuration

    Put the path to voicevox engine in the configuration file.
    Note that the path should be absolute path, pointing to the directory containing the `run.exe` file.

    ```json

    "voice_vox_path": "path/to/voicevox"
    }
    ```

    You can also change the speaker by changing the configuration file.
    Refer to the [speaker file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lekiet1214/ani-voice/main/speakers.json) for more
    information.

    ```json
    {
    "speaker": "speaker_id"
    }
    ```

    ### Usage

    By default, this software will use the first audio device as input and the VB-CABLE device as output.

    ```javascript
    python main.py
    ```
